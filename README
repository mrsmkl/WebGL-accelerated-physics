balls_collide.html -- With GPU physics

Sample of GPU accelerated physics simulation with WebGL.
The page layout and rendering spheres are copied from
"Learning WebGL" (http://learningwebgl.com).

Currently this is just a sample and not usable library.
I intend to clean up the code soon, though.

Send any ideas and hints to me.
